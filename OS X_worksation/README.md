## FakePDF

This Cocoa app is made to look like a PDF file. You can name it "Financial Report" for example, store it on a USB flash drive and drop it on in your building.

When someone will find the USB stick and try to read the doc, the app will start a custom script you can customize, open a real PDF and wipe itself.

Default implementation of the script recommand to ask the Mac to say something with a loud voice and then send an e-mail to all employees offering food and brevage for tomorrow breakfast.
